Steps to start both Backend (Springboot) and Front Applications (React).

1: Prerquisite: 
	1.1: Node js/npm to start the frontend application.
	1.2: Eclipse IDE to run the backend application.
	1.3: JDK 1.8.
2: download Project from this link: https://github.com/nitin5097/SpringBootAndReactApp.git

3: In the eclipe IDE, import existing maven project from the SpringBootAndReactApp folder.

4: Right click on the project root folder: "SpringBootAndReactApp", then click on "Run As" -> "Maven build".
   Type "clean install" in the goal and click "run".

5: Once the build is successful on the console, open AssignmentApplication.java from location-                         		                 "SpringBootAndReactApp/src/main/java/com/assignment/developer/backend/AssignmentApplication.java". 
   Right click on the Java page and click "Run As" and click "Java application". The backend will be up in a minute with some Json data on the console.
  
6: After the backend is up, now we need to run the front end application (React). For this go the root folder "SpringBootAndReactApp", 
   then click on "app" folder.

7: In the app folder open cmd (command prompt) and run below commands:

	7.1: npm install
	7.2: npm start
 
8: You will be redirected to browser with running Application.

Note: If your backend is showing error as 8080 port is already used, follow these steps:
  Step 1: Open the application.properties from "SpringBootAndReactApp/src/main/resources/application.properties" location.
  Step 2: Write explicitely "sever.port = 8081/8082" and save the file.
  Step 3: Run the backend application following Step 5 Above.
  
  And with respect to this change of port number, follow these steps to accomodate the change in Frontend Application as well:
  
  Step 1: Open "package.json" in "app" folder in a notepad.
  Step 2: Update the port number in the below mentioned line:
           "proxy": "http://localhost:8080", 
  Step 3: Save the file and run the "npm start" command in the command prompt.
  Step 4: Your Application will be up.
